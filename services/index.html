                                The United States of America has the most progressive tax system in the
                                world. This means that our tax system is also the most complex in the world.
                                Each tax payer’s case is unique. You may be an individual who works for
                                someone or you may be self-employed. You might have employees. You might
                                have a business partner. You may have incorporated. These are all factors
                                that make your case unique, and require in depth knowledge when it comes
                                time to file.
                                At DFC, our tax professionals are trained to help you with your unique case.
                                We specialize in personal taxation, S-Corporations, LLC’s, and general
                                partnership taxation.
                                With the massive tax law changes brought about by the Tax Cuts and Jobs
                                Act recently passed by congress, you have never had a greater need for a
                                trained tax professional than now.

                                Americans are living much longer than ever before, and saving less than ever
                                before. Four in ten men and half of women will live past the age of 90. One
                                in seven men and one in four women will live past the age of 95. Half of
                                Americans have less than $10,000 saved for retirement. Social security will
                                become insolvent by 2034 and Medicare will become insolvent by 2026.</p>

                                Our life and health are not guaranteed. When you have a
                                family, mortgage, car payments, credit card debts, and day to day bills, you
                                must be alive and healthy in order to continue to provide for your family and for your
                                future. </p>
                            <p>Life insurance with living benefits is a perfect way to make sure that if you
                                die, you could pay off your bills, provide replacement income for your
                                family, and send your kids to college. Also, with living benefits, if you get a
                                terminal illness, chronic illness, critical illness, or a critical injury, you can
                                access your life insurance while you are living. At DFC, our brokerage does
                                business with all the insurance companies in the USA. We will find you the
                                best rate, and the plan that works for you.</p>

                                Health insurance policies are not a one size fits all. Some people want
                                expensive comprehensive coverage. Some people would rather save money
                                by only getting coverage for major health incidents. Some people would like
                                government subsidized healthcare. Others, such as the elderly, qualify for
                                Medicare programs. At DFC, our agents will find the best fit for your needs.
